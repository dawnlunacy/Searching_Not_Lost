# Searching_Not_Lost

Searching Not Lost is a 2 day project to challenge myself to learn an entirely new framework, Vue, by building a static website that utilizes an API. This applicaiton can be used to search different key words and see photos the correlate to that topic. This application uses the Unsplash API.
